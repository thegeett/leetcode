This is kind of Fibonacci series problem, Here let say there is just one stair then it will take 1 distinct way. If 2 then 2 distinct way. 
Now understand, if 3 then possible ways are 1 + 1+ 1, 2 + 1 and 1+ 2, so if we relate this with fibonacci series then 3 = 1, 2. 

Now for 4 think we fibonacci then 1,2,3,5. 5 is the answer as it comes to 4th index. 

You can do it with recurssion check solution.

Also check O(N) and O(1) solution too.
